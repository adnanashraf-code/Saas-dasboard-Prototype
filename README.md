🚀 Velora --- Premium SaaS Productivity Dashboard

Velora is a modern SaaS-style productivity dashboard built using pure
frontend technologies. It combines project tracking, task management,
finance overview, analytics, and user personalization into a clean and
professional interface inspired by modern tools like Linear and Notion.

This project focuses on structured UI architecture, real interaction
logic, and persistent state management using localStorage.

🎯 Project Objective

Velora was developed to simulate a real SaaS dashboard experience while
demonstrating:

Advanced frontend UI design DOM manipulation and interactive behavior
State persistence with localStorage Component-based layout thinking SaaS
workflow simulation Clean architecture without frameworks

The goal is to create a portfolio-ready dashboard that feels
production-level.

✨ Core Features

📊 Dashboard Overview Revenue summary cards Active users indicator Task
completion metrics Productivity score visualization Animated progress
indicators Clean widget-based layout

✅ Task Management Add and manage daily tasks Priority tagging system
Deadline tracking Completion toggle Dynamic progress updates Persistent
task storage

💰 Finance Overview Income and expense breakdown Transaction list
simulation Balance calculation logic Monthly summary visualization

⚙️ Settings System

Velora includes a structured and interactive settings module:

🎨 UI & Design Philosophy

Velora follows a premium minimal SaaS design style:

Clean spacing system Modern typography Subtle shadows Gradient accents
Micro-interactions Smooth transitions Button hover and press animations
